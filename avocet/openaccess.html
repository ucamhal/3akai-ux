                    <p>Open access makes scholarly research freely available online. You continue to have control and the ability to choose where to publish. With the new HEFCE policy we want to ensure your work is eligible for the next REF</p>

                        <li>Failure to adhere might affect your future funding</li>
                        <li>We can provide you with advice on your funder’s and your publisher’s open access policy</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>provide you with guidance on the open access policy of your publisher, if you give us the name of the journal</li>

                        <h3>Why open access?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The move towards open access is motivated by two things; the importance of free and open access to research and the new policies established by HEFCE and other funders, including RCUK and The Wellcome Trust.</p>
                    <p>In establishing this service we are ensuring your are compliant with your funder’s open access policies, publisher’s terms and the REF.</p>
                    <p>We want to ensure that all of our researchers are able to continue to receive funding that enables them to continue to do exceptional, high quality and pioneering research while reaching as wide an audience as possible.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Open access removes restrictions to view and read a work and allows reuse, redistribution and modification of the work with attribution. It increases access to literature and knowledge, widening the spread of ideas. This has both a societal and an economic impact.</p>
                    <p>For the author and researcher, open access enables them to raise the visibility and profile of their research and to increase its impact.</p>
                    <p>This move towards openness and transparency is positive for the awareness and visibility of publicly-funded research.</p>

                        <h3>How open access affects the publishing cycle (open access publishing options)</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>There are two different models for open access; Self-archiving versus ‘Pay to Publish’</p>

                        <header>
                            <h4>Self-archiving</h4>
                        </header>
                        <p>The deposit of peer reviewed manuscripts in an open access repository. This is often described as the “Green” model. Publishers often stipulate a fixed period of time before the article can be made freely available (an embargo).</p>
                        <h5>What does this mean for you?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This increases the availability and visibility of your work</li>
                            <li>It removes the need for a publications fee</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The embargo process delays the accessibility of published work</li>
                            <li>There is a reliance for researchers to upload their own papers, adding to workload</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The university prefers the self-archiving model yet we are conscious of ensuring this new system is as simple and accessible as possible for researchers.</p>

                        <p>This provides free universal access to the final published versions of articles immediately on publication with the requirement of a publisher’s fee to be made. This is often described as the “Gold” model.</p>
                        <h5>What does this mean for you?</h5>
                        <p>Provides immediate access to journals as soon as they are published.</p>
                        <p>Meets the requirement of certain funders e.g., RCUK.</p>

                        <p>A publisher’s fee, often known as the Article Processing Charge (APC) needs to be paid. The University and funders may help in the payment of this (find out more)</p>

                    <p>The embargo is a fixed period of time a publisher might establish to delay the open access publication of a manuscript. These embargo periods may differ in length from 6 - 36 months and vary in subject fields. This will affect when your manuscript will be able to be viewed and accessed. We can help you find out how a publisher’s embargo might affect you.</p>
