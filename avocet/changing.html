                    <p>HEFCE has a new policy for open access in the next Research Excellence Framework (REF).</p>
                    <p>HEFCE policy requires you to upload your accepted, peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings to an institutional repository.</p>
                    <p>RCUK, Wellcome and other funders also have various policies relating to the open access and licensing of your research.</p>
                    <p><a href="/me">Upload your accepted manuscripts</a> to meet this requirement and make sure you are compliant with the REF, your funder’s and publisher’s open access policies.</p>

                    <p>All accepted journal articles and conference proceedings (with an SSIN) should be <a href="/me">uploaded</a>, to ensure they are eligible for the next REF.</p>
                    <p>It does not apply to monographs, book chapters or other long-form publications, working papers, creative or practice-based research outputs or data.</p>

                    <p>HEFCE policy requires manuscripts to be uploaded no later than three months after acceptance.</p>
                    <p>This policy comes into force on 1 April 2016. Yet at the University we want to ensure this shift is managed sooner rather than later to ensure no research is omitted.</p>
                    <p>When you upload your manuscript you will be guided through the process, making it as simple and clear as possible.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>By <a href="/me">uploading your peer-reviewed manuscript</a> as soon as it is accepted by a publisher, you adhere to HEFCE policy.</p>
                    <p>This is the easiest way of letting us know you are being published.</p>
                    <p>We can help you to ensure your REF eligibility.</p>
                    <p>Failure to do so could affect your access to future funding.</p>
                    <p>Publisher embargoes are respected (the period when you can only access an article with a paid access). Manuscripts must be free to read and download after the following periods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>12 months for STEM subjects</li>
                        <li>24 months for Humanities subjects</li>

                    <p>Funders have a range of open access policies, licensing and copyright requirements.</p>
                    <p>To make this process is simple as possible for you, when you upload your manuscript we’ll ask for the details of those who funded your research.</p>
                    <p>Therefore we can ensure you adhere to their requirements.</p>
