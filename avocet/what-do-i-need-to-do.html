                    <p>Your rights will vary depending on your publisher. Many Copyright Transfer Agreements already allow you to comply with HEFCE and some other funders’ Open Access policies.</p>
                    <p>Publishers may choose to licence back some rights in your work e.g. for use in teaching or to promote your research. You may prefer to retain your rights, rather than give them to the publisher and try to get them back later.</p>
                    <p>You have two copyright options;</p>

                        <p>A Copyright Transfer Agreement (CTA) may give your publisher copyright and might affect how and when you can make your manuscript Open Access.</p>

                        <p>The University of Cambridge Scholars' Addendum enables you to change the traditional agreement you have with your publisher. You still transfer copyright, but include a proviso covering digital usage and access.</p>
                        <p>How to use the Addendum:</p>
                        <ol>

                            <li>Date and sign the agreement.</li>
                            <li>Attach the agreement to the publisher’s Copyright Transfer Agreement.</li>

                    <p>Licences are used to tell the reader what rights they are being given in relation to the paper/article when they access it. Different publishers offer a range of licensing agreements. Licences affect how your work can be copied, distributed, shared and how others can use it, commercially and non-commercially.</p>
                    <p>Some funders (e.g. RCUK, Wellcome Trust) specify what licence Open Access content should be published under. If this applies to your article, we'll check whether your journal offers the right licence and advise you if you need to take any further action.</p>

                    </header>

                    <p>Most funders require you to acknowledge your funder when your manuscript is published.</p>
                    <p>The Research Information Network has developed a standard acknowledgment which is acceptable to all funders. Acknowledgements should follow these guidelines;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the funding agency name should be written in full</li>
                        <li>the grant number should be in square brackets</li>
                        <li>multiple grant numbers should be separated by a comma and space</li>
                        <li>funding agencies should be separated by a semi-colon.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>E.g. 'This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number], [grant number]; Medical Research Council [grant number] and Cancer Research UK [grant number]</p>
