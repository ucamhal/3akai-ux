                    <p>Open access funds are available at the University, funded by RCUK and The Wellcome Trust. Both funding bodies have set conditions linked to the use of a publisher’s fee.</p>
                    <p>For RCUK funded articles that are compliant with RCUK open access policies, the University can pay for colour and page charges. The University cannot pay for other funders’ colour, page and image charges; these are the responsibility of the author.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>When you return your edited manuscript to your publisher you are asked to sign a Copyright Transfer Agreement. This is standard in most traditional publication agreements. It is important for you to retain rights as an author enabling you to publish your work open access, use it in teaching materials and to promote your research work i.e., via your website.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>A traditional publisher’s agreement, which sees you transfer copyright to the publisher, might affect your eligibility for the next REF.</p>
                        <p>Retaining copyright, or adding an addendum which allows you to comply with funders’ open access policies, will ensure your work is eligible. It will also help you reach a wider audience and have more control over how the distribution of your work online.</p>

                    <p>Your Accepted Author Manuscript will be uploaded to the University of Cambridge (University) repository and will be embargoed until at least the publication date. Unless you agree otherwise, your manuscript will not be open access immediately. Instead we will contact you to confirm how you would like us to proceed once the publisher’s embargo period has ended. If we cannot contact you we will publish your manuscript in accordance with the funder policy to ensure it is eligible for REF.</p>
                    <p>The University will not publish, distribute or modify your work until after the funder’s embargo expires without your permission.</p>
