                        <p>HEFCE policy requires manuscripts to be uploaded no later than three months after acceptance. This policy comes into force on 1 April 2016. Yet at the University we want to ensure this shift is managed sooner rather than later, so that no research is omitted.</p>
                        <p>Uploading at acceptance lets us check your options and advise you how to fill in copyright or Open Access forms to comply with other funders’ requirements, and – in eligible cases – to commit funds to cover Open Access fees.</p>
