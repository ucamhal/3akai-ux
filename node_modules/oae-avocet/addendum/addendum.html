                <h5>Why might you want to retain copyright?</h5>
                <p>A traditional publisher’s agreement, which sees you transfer copyright to the publisher, might affect your eligibility for the next REF which requires work to be submitted for open access at the time of publication. A traditional copyright agreement may affect your ability to share your work online.</p>
                <p>Retaining copyright, or adding an addendum which allows you to comply with funders’ open access policies, will ensure your work is eligible. It will also help you reach a wider audience and have more control over how the distribution of your work online.</p>
                <h5>Use an author addendum</h5>
                <p>The SPARC Author Addendum enables you to change the traditional agreement you have with your publisher to allow you to retain key rights in relation to your work. You still transfer copyright, but keep some rights back for yourself, allowing you an element of control over how and where you share your work.</p>
